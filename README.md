#Thermal Resistance Analysis in Metal Rods with Air Gaps

This project investigates the **effect of air gaps on thermal resistance** in metal rods by evaluating **contact resistance** in segmented vs. solid rods. The study uses steady-state heat transfer experiments to compare temperature profiles and understand the role of interfacial resistance.

## 📊 Objective

To experimentally verify that **air gaps increase thermal resistance** due to contact resistance by comparing a solid metal rod with a segmented rod of the same material and dimensions.

---

## 🧪 Methodology

* Conducted experiments on both **solid** and **segmented** rods.
* Heat applied to one end; steady-state temperatures recorded at multiple points along the rod.
* Data analyzed to extract temperature gradients and infer resistance.
* Used matlab to visualize temperature distributions and compare thermal behavior.

---

## 📈 Key Findings

* Segmented rods showed higher temperature drops across air gaps.
* Quantified the increased thermal resistance due to **interfacial contact resistance**.
* Plots and analysis validate that air gaps significantly affect heat transfer.
